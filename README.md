# Restaurant_Description_Builder
This Python script implements a chatbot that acts as a culinary expert. Given a list of menu items provided by the user, the chatbot generates a two-line text to describe the restaurant's expertise. The chatbot utilizes the following components:

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Model: To generate responses based on the provided menu items.
Gradio: For creating an interactive chat interface where users can input their menu items and receive responses.
Langchain Library: Provides utilities for integrating conversational models like GPT-3.5.
Prompt Template: To structure the conversation between the user and the chatbot.
Conversation Buffer Memory: To maintain a history of the conversation for context-aware responses.
